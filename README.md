README FOR BARBARIC BULWARK

#DESC:
 An action-packed survival game where you play as a lone bandit defending against waves of dark enemies and flying arrows. 
 Use quick reflexes to strike enemies and block arrows, aiming to survive as long as possible.

#FEATURES: 
Endless waves of enemies that increases over time
- One hit kill system used for both enemies and the player
- High score tracking to record the most enemies you’ve slain in a run
- If an arrow collides with the player, or an enemy finishes their attack animation against you, game over!

#CONTROLS:
Q: Activate the left shield to defend against arrows (time it to destroy the game object)
E: Activate the right shield to defend against arrows (time it to destroy the game object)
Left Arrow: Attack to the left, eliminating the closest enemy within range on that side
Right Arrow: Attack to the right, eliminating the closest enemy within range on that side


#KNOWN ISSUES:
Lack of enemy death animation. In late game, it would linger around too long and block the player's line of sight of existing enemies.
Current use to end game is just ending the play testing. This works for my testing but I didn’t know how to end the game otherwise 

#FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
Game Over Ending Screen
A better difficulty curve (the game is naturally quite difficult, but it was based around my skill for demonstration purposes)
